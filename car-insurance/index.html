      <h2>Understanding Car Insurance in NZ</h2>

      <h3>Comprehensive Insurance</h3>
      <p>The most complete coverage available. Protects your car and others from accidents, theft, fire, and weather damage. Recommended for newer or more valuable vehicles.</p>

      <h3>Third Party, Fire & Theft</h3>
      <p>Covers damage you cause to other people's property, plus protection if your car is stolen or damaged by fire. A middle-ground option for mid-value vehicles.</p>

      <h3>Third Party Only</h3>
      <p>The minimum recommended coverage. Only pays for damage you cause to other vehicles and property. Best for older cars with low value.</p>

      <h3>Tips to Lower Your Premium</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose a higher excess (if you can afford it at claim time)</li>
        <li>Install approved security devices</li>
        <li>Bundle with other insurance (home, contents)</li>
        <li>Maintain a clean driving record</li>
        <li>Compare quotes from multiple providers</li>
      </ul>
