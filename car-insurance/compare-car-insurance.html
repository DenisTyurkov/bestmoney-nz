intro: "Finding the right car insurance in New Zealand doesn't have to be complicated. We've compared coverage options, pricing, and claims service from NZ's top insurers to help you make an informed choice."

faqs:
  - question: "What types of car insurance are available in NZ?"
    answer: "There are three main types: Comprehensive (covers your car and others for accidents, theft, fire, and damage), Third Party Fire & Theft (covers damage to others' property plus fire and theft of your vehicle), and Third Party Only (only covers damage you cause to other vehicles and property). Most drivers choose comprehensive for newer cars and third party for older vehicles."

  - question: "How much does car insurance cost in NZ?"
    answer: "Car insurance premiums in NZ vary widely based on your vehicle, age, location, and driving history. Comprehensive cover typically costs $500-$1,500 per year, while third party can be as low as $200-$500. Factors like your suburb, car model, and claims history significantly impact your premium."

  - question: "What affects my car insurance premium?"
    answer: "Key factors include: your age and driving experience, the car's make, model and age, where you live and park, your claims history, how much you drive annually, your chosen excess amount, and any safety features on your vehicle. Young drivers and those in high-theft areas typically pay more."

  - question: "Should I choose agreed value or market value?"
    answer: "Agreed value locks in a payout amount when you take out the policy - you know exactly what you'll receive if your car is written off. Market value pays what your car is worth at claim time, which depreciates over time. Agreed value costs slightly more but provides certainty, especially important for newer vehicles."

  - question: "What's the difference between excess and premium?"
    answer: "Your premium is the regular amount you pay for insurance (monthly or annually). Your excess is what you pay out of pocket when making a claim. Choosing a higher excess typically lowers your premium, but means you pay more if you need to claim. Consider what you can afford at claim time."

  - question: "How do I make a car insurance claim in NZ?"
    answer: "Most insurers allow claims via phone, online, or through their app. You'll need to provide details of the incident, photos of damage, a police report (for theft or hit and run), and details of any other parties involved. Claims are typically assessed within a few days, though complex cases may take longer."
