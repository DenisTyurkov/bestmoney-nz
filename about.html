      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>BestMoney NZ was created with a simple goal: to help New Zealanders find the best financial products without the hassle of searching dozens of websites.</p>

      <p>We believe everyone deserves access to clear, unbiased information when making important financial decisions. Whether you're looking for a personal loan to consolidate debt, financing for your first car, or insurance to protect your vehicle, we're here to help you compare your options.</p>

      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>We research and compare products from New Zealand's leading banks, lenders, and insurance providers. Our team analyses rates, fees, features, and customer reviews to create comprehensive comparisons that help you make informed choices.</p>

      <h2>Our Independence</h2>
      <p>While we may receive commissions when you click through to a provider's website, this never influences our rankings or recommendations. Our comparisons are based on objective criteria including rates, terms, fees, and customer satisfaction.</p>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>
      <p>Have questions or feedback? We'd love to hear from you. Reach out to our team and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
