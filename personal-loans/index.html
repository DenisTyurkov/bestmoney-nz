      <h2>What to Consider When Choosing a Personal Loan</h2>

      <h3>Interest Rate</h3>
      <p>Personal loan rates in NZ range from about 8.99% to 29.99%. Your rate depends on your credit score, income, and the lender. Always compare the total cost, not just the monthly payment.</p>

      <h3>Loan Term</h3>
      <p>Terms typically range from 1-7 years. Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but less interest overall. Longer terms lower your payments but cost more in interest.</p>

      <h3>Fees</h3>
      <p>Watch out for establishment fees, monthly service fees, and early repayment fees. Some lenders advertise low rates but charge high fees. Look at the total cost of the loan.</p>

      <h3>Flexibility</h3>
      <p>Can you make extra repayments without penalty? What happens if you need to skip a payment? Choose a loan that fits your financial situation.</p>
