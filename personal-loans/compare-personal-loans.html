faqs:
  - question: "What credit score do I need for a personal loan in NZ?"
    answer: "Most NZ lenders require a credit score of 500+ for personal loan approval. However, requirements vary by lender. Those with excellent credit (700+) typically qualify for the lowest interest rates, while borrowers with fair credit (500-650) may still qualify but at higher rates. Some online lenders like Harmoney and Nectar are more flexible with credit requirements."

  - question: "How much can I borrow with a personal loan?"
    answer: "Personal loan amounts in New Zealand typically range from $1,000 to $70,000, depending on the lender and your financial situation. Factors affecting your borrowing limit include income, existing debts, credit history, and employment status. The major banks typically offer up to $50,000, while some lenders like Westpac and Harmoney offer up to $70,000."

  - question: "What's the average interest rate for personal loans in NZ?"
    answer: "Personal loan interest rates in New Zealand currently range from approximately 8.99% to 29.99% p.a. The rate you receive depends on your credit profile, loan amount, and term length. Secured loans typically offer lower rates than unsecured options. The best rates (under 10%) are usually reserved for borrowers with excellent credit."

  - question: "How long does it take to get approved for a personal loan?"
    answer: "Online lenders can provide approval decisions within minutes to a few hours. Traditional banks may take 1-3 business days. Once approved, funds are typically disbursed within 1-2 business days, though some lenders offer same-day funding for existing customers. ANZ, for example, offers same-day approval for existing customers."

  - question: "Can I pay off my personal loan early?"
    answer: "Most NZ lenders allow early repayment, but policies vary. Some charge early repayment fees (typically 1-2% of the remaining balance), while others like ANZ and ASB offer fee-free early repayment. Always check the terms before signing, and look for lenders that specifically advertise no early repayment fees."

  - question: "What documents do I need to apply for a personal loan?"
    answer: "Typically you'll need proof of identity (passport or driver's licence), proof of income (payslips or tax returns), bank statements from the last 3 months, and proof of address. Self-employed applicants may need additional documentation such as financial statements. Most online lenders can verify income digitally, speeding up the process."
