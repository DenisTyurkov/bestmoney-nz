      <h2>Car Loan Tips for Kiwis</h2>

      <h3>Get Pre-Approved First</h3>
      <p>Before you start car shopping, get pre-approved for a loan. This tells you your budget and gives you negotiating power at the dealer. Most banks offer quick pre-approval online.</p>

      <h3>Secured vs Unsecured</h3>
      <p>Secured loans use the car as collateral and offer lower rates. Unsecured loans are more flexible but cost more. For most buyers, secured is the better choice.</p>

      <h3>Watch the Total Cost</h3>
      <p>A longer loan term means lower payments but more interest paid overall. Use our comparison to see the true cost of each option, not just the monthly payment.</p>

      <h3>Consider Your Options</h3>
      <p>Don't just accept dealer finance - compare it with bank loans first. Dealers may offer promotional rates on new cars, but bank loans often beat standard dealer rates.</p>
