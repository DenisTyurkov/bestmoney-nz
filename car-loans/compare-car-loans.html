intro: "Whether you're buying your first car or upgrading to something new, we've compared car loan options from NZ's top banks and specialist lenders to help you find the best deal for your situation."

faqs:
  - question: "Should I get a secured or unsecured car loan?"
    answer: "Secured car loans use the vehicle as collateral and typically offer lower interest rates (9-15% vs 12-25%). However, if you fail to repay, the lender can repossess the car. Unsecured loans don't require collateral but come with higher rates. For most buyers, a secured loan is the better choice if you're confident in your ability to repay."

  - question: "Can I get a car loan with bad credit in NZ?"
    answer: "Yes, some lenders like Turners Finance and MTF Finance accept applicants with poor credit. However, you'll likely face higher interest rates (20-30%+) and may need to provide a larger deposit. Consider improving your credit score before applying, or look at dealer finance options that may be more flexible."

  - question: "How much deposit do I need for a car loan?"
    answer: "Most NZ lenders don't require a deposit for car loans if your credit is good. However, a deposit of 10-20% can help you secure a lower interest rate and reduce your monthly payments. For those with fair or poor credit, a larger deposit may be required or could significantly improve your approval chances."

  - question: "What's the best car loan term length?"
    answer: "Car loan terms in NZ range from 1-7 years. Shorter terms (2-3 years) mean higher monthly payments but less total interest paid. Longer terms (5-7 years) lower your payments but cost more overall. Consider the car's expected lifespan - avoid owing more than the car is worth. For most buyers, 3-5 years is the sweet spot."

  - question: "Can I get pre-approved for a car loan?"
    answer: "Yes, most major NZ banks offer car loan pre-approval. This tells you how much you can borrow before you start shopping, giving you negotiating power at the dealership. Pre-approval typically lasts 30-90 days and involves a credit check. ASB and BNZ are particularly good for quick pre-approval."

  - question: "Is it better to finance through a dealer or bank?"
    answer: "Bank loans often have lower interest rates than dealer finance, but dealers may offer promotional 0% or low-rate deals on new cars. Compare the total cost including fees, not just the interest rate. Also consider flexibility - bank loans typically offer more repayment options. Always shop around before accepting dealer finance."
